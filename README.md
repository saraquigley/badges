# Generation
### In order to generate a GIF first call the phantom.js from the console. This scripts
captures 10 images (JPGs) from a certain webpage as defined in index.html:
````
phantomjs lib/index.js
````
### After generating the JPGs we generate the actual GIF from the JPG frames.
We use the **convert** command which comes with Imagemagick
````
convert -loop 0 output/frame-*.png test.gif
````
